Recursion:
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. 

example: Towers of Hanoi (TOH),DFS of Graph etc.

Need of recursion:
we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. 
 For example; The Factorial of a number.

Algorithm: Steps
Step1 - Define a base case:
Step2 - Define a recursive case:
Step3 - Ensure the recursion terminates:
step4 - Combine the solutions:


How recursion stored in memory.?
The recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) Structure just like the stack data structure.

code of recursion:
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
